            If you want to climb Mount Everest, you can recursively climb the smaller parts until you reach
    the top. The base case would be the top, and you would have a recursive function climb() which
    does the job.
    - Imagine if there are 4 camps to Mount Everest, your recursive function would make you climb
    the first one, then both 1 and 2, then 1-2-3 and so on. This would be tiring, cost more, and a lot
    of unnecessary work. Why would you repeat the work you’ve already done? This is where
    memoization comes in.
    - If you use memoization, you would store your camp ground once you reach it, so the next time
    your recursive function works, it’ll get the camp ground value from the stored set
